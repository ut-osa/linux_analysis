cil-svn/
For convenience, this repository contains the cil svn tree that was current
at the time of development.  The exact revision may have been lost to the
ages, but it was likely HEAD around 4/11/2010.  This should be built first.

cil-tools/
A set of functions that explore the tree provided by CIL and produce
interesting output in the form of C source.  Most of this is organized by
the numeric id assigned to each type in typever.ml.  invoke_gcc.py is a
wrapper for gcc used to build the analysis - it contains a blacklist of any
files that CIL just can't seem to handle.

gen_src/
Build directory for analyzed kernel and output directory for generated C
source.  Uses gen_src/kernel.config as a config file to build the desired
kernel, as specified by the LINUX and KERNEL_ARCH variables in Makefile.

parse_dwarf/
Stale code for looking at textual dumps of DWARF information.  Here be
dragons.
